# Nordish-Fox
Theme for Firefox 77

**I use the font Ubuntu which you can find here https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/0cef8205-ubuntu-font-family-0.83.zip otherwise you have to change it in the userchrome file.  Also make sure to enable Firefox dark mode theme**

## Startpage


To use the custom startpage, make sure the folder is placed inside your profile folder, and place localsettings.js in Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\pref and mozilla.cfg in Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\.

Inside mozilla.cfg replace "file:///C:/<path removed>/newtab.html" to the directory your index.html is located on your computer.
